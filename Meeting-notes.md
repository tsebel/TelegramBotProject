## Meeting 1 – July 12, 2025  
**Attendees:** Tsebel & Ephrata  
**Platform:** Telegram chat  

We brainstormed ideas for our Telegram bot project and decided to build StudyGuardianBot — a productivity bot designed to help users stay focused through features like a Pomodoro timer, motivational quotes, task tracking, and reminders. We aligned on responsibilities and both began implementing the bot's core functionalities.

We collaborated on coding the bot using Node.js and the Telegraf library. Together, we worked on implementing key commands such as /study, /pause, /break, /resume, and /quote, and successfully integrated a motivational quote API. We tested the bot live on Telegram to confirm smooth functionality.

**Platform:** Telegram voice call  

We finalized our GitHub collaboration process and worked on separate branches to contribute code. Both of us made meaningful additions and improvements to the bot from our respective branches. We agreed to use pull requests and peer code reviews before merging into the main branch.
We also discussed best practices for keeping sensitive data like the bot token secure and took steps to prevent any exposure.

**Platform:** Voice call & Telegram chat  

We cleaned the repository history to remove an accidentally exposed token using BFG, replaced the real token in .env.example with a safe placeholder, and finalized the README.md file with clear setup instructions and a concise project pitch. We pushed the cleaned commits and prepared the repository for final review and merging.
